It is a simple text file editor for Android. You can use it via a file manager app. I use it to write some notes. The fixed default file path is <i>Documents/click.dummer.textthing/notes.txt</i> . If you open the app, this file will be opened, created and used for store.

<b>There is no file manager integrated. The import feature uses the system filemanager.</b>
